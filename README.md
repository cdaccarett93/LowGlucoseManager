# LowGlucoseManager

The applications sole purpose is to provide a functional calculation that will yield exact amounts of the fast acting sugar source (skittles) to bring your levels back to normal. Example if you have a low blood sugar reading of 60mg/dl the formula will require your target level(the level you want to elevate your glucose level to) and your current blood glucose value. It also required your insulin sensitivity (how sensitive your body is to the effects of insulin) which is given by your endocrinologist, as well as your insulin to carb ratio (how many units of insulin you need per carb). Next the application runs the calculation and it will give you the exact amount of skittles to eat (i.e. i would need 17 skittles to raise my glucose level from 60mg/dL to 120mg/dL (+-10mg/dL)). Another feature is Geolocation in our app, type 1 diabetics run the risk of passing out and potentially being in a diabetic comma if blood sugar levels drop to dangerous levels. Our app will sense such levels and send an exact geolocation to your guardians in case you are unconscious to answer. This feature will bring great peace of mind to most parents considering such disease is most common in juveniles. The app also has a feature to map nearby stores in case the you do not have any fast acting carbs.
